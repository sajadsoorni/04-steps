- **State Management:** Understanding how to use React's `useState` to update the user interface dynamically.
- **Forms in React:** Building forms using controlled elements to manage user input effectively.
- **Props and State:** Applying these concepts in both theory and practice.

## Key Features

- Interactive flashcards allowing users to test their knowledge.
- Real-time updates to the UI through React's state.
- Controlled form elements for seamless user input handling.

## Technologies Used

- **React** — For building component-based user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — For logic and interactivity.
- **CSS** — For styling the flashcards and forms.
